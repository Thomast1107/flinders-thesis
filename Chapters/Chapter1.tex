\subsection{Project Focus}


Developed countries have vital sign monitoring device which are more expensive and they are less affordable for backward communities. This project aims in providing inexpensive monitoring device platform with the help of PCI controller. This platform will be helpful for the hospitals and researchers during power failure or shutdown. (Chapter \ref{chapter:firstchapter}).Pulse oximetry is a cheap and noninvasive method of measurement which can be carried ouy by counting the pulse rate. In order to reduce the expense fingertip sensor can be easily obtained from the local drug shop around dollar 25USD. (Section \ref{sec:firstsection}).Backward areas and disaster prone areas may lack energy supply for the normal working of the medical device. This can be rectified by using the solar panels in the backside of the device. The platform also provides a display unit of 1/2inch 800x450.

The main focus of the project is to reduce the private competitive mentality and to provide a cheap platform for the startups.

\subsection{Project Problems}

Every project implementation process has got its own pros and cons. Pros includes many positive innovations for this device platform. The main problem or cons for this project is the cost of certification. This process of certification is a main problem in the implementation and the determination of the cost of that device. This is the only reason for the hike in the price of the medical devices in the current market.

The second problem which can be pointed out is the implementation of the solar panel in the medical device. As per the current market it  is expensive to implement the solar panel in the medical device.This may result in the increased expense while building the platform. But it can also be achieved in a very low cost.
